# Human Approval

## On-Demand Human-in-the-Loop for Irreversible Actions

The boundary between agent autonomy and safety. When an action is irreversible -- sending money, deleting data, deploying to production, sending external communications -- get a human to review and sign off before it happens.

---

## Why Human Approval?

Autonomous agents can do reversible things confidently. But some actions cannot be undone:

- A sent email cannot be unsent
- A financial transfer cannot be recalled
- Deleted data may be gone forever
- A production deployment affects real users
- A signed contract is legally binding

For these moments, having a human verify intent and context is worth the small cost.

## How It Works

### 1. Submit Approval Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://unbound.md/api/approve \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_id": "my-agent",
    "category": "financial",
    "action_description": "Send $5,000 USDC to 0xABC... for monthly hosting payment",
    "context": {
      "recipient": "0xABC...",
      "amount": 5000,
      "reason": "Monthly hosting bill - recurring payment"
    },
    "params": {
      "urgency": "standard",
      "transaction_amount": 5000,
      "max_price_usdc": 50
    },
    "webhook_url": "https://my-agent.com/approval-callback"
  }'
```

### 2. Human Reviews

A human reviews the action description and context. They assess:

- Is this action consistent with the agent's stated purpose?
- Are the amounts and targets reasonable?
- Are there any red flags?

### 3. Receive Decision

The human responds with one of:

- **Approved**: Action is safe to proceed
- **Denied**: Action should not proceed (with reason)
- **Modified**: Action should proceed with changes (details provided)

Result is delivered via deal message and optional webhook callback.

## Example Use Cases

### Approve a Large Payment

> "I need to pay my hosting provider $5000 but my autonomous spending limit is $1000."

**Solution**: Submit a `financial` approval with transaction details. Human verifies the recipient and amount, then approves.

### Review an Email Before Sending

> "I'm drafting a partnership proposal to a potential client and want a human to review before I send it."

**Solution**: Submit a `communication` approval with the email draft. Human reviews tone, accuracy, and appropriateness.

### Confirm Data Deletion

> "A user has requested GDPR data deletion. I want human confirmation before I permanently delete their records."

**Solution**: Submit a `data` approval with `destructive: true`. Human verifies the request is legitimate and confirms deletion.
