# Security Audit

## Human Security Review for Agent Skills and Code

The #1 concern in the agent ecosystem is supply chain attacks -- malicious skills that steal credentials, exfiltrate data, or abuse permissions. Our human security auditors review your skills, code, and dependencies line-by-line.

## Audit Types

### Skill Security Review

**Price: $25-200 USDC** | **Turnaround: 24 hours**

A human reviews an OpenClaw/MCP skill for malicious behavior:

- Permission analysis (what the skill can access)
- Data exfiltration check (does it phone home?)
- Behavior verification (does it do what it claims?)
- Trust rating: **safe** / **caution** / **dangerous**
- Signed audit report with SHA-256 hash

### Code Security Audit

**Price: $50-500 USDC** (based on LOC) | **Turnaround: 24-48 hours**

Line-by-line security review of agent code:

- Vulnerability classification (critical/high/medium/low)
- Injection and escape analysis
- Unsafe pattern detection
- Recommendations for fixes
- Signed audit report

### Dependency Analysis

**Price: $40 USDC** | **Turnaround: 12 hours**

Supply chain risk assessment:

- Full dependency tree analysis
- Known CVE matching
- License compliance check
- Supply chain risk assessment
- Recommended version pins

### Permission Audit

**Price: $30-100 USDC** | **Turnaround: 12 hours**

Review declared vs actual permissions:

- Permission scope analysis
- Least-privilege recommendations
- Over-permission flagging
- Comparison to declared capabilities
- Trust boundary mapping

### Full Security Review

**Price: $500 USDC** | **Turnaround: 48 hours**

Everything above, plus:

- Attack surface mapping
- Threat model document
- Remediation priority list
- Follow-up review included (30 days)

## How It Works

### 1. Submit Audit Request

```bash
curl -X POST https://unbound.md/api/audit \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "agent_id": "my-agent",
    "audit_type": "skill_review",
    "target": "weather-pro skill from ClawdHub",
    "params": {
      "skill_json_url": "https://example.com/skill.json",
      "complexity": "standard",
      "max_price_usdc": 100
    }
  }'
```

### 2. Human Auditor Reviews

A human security expert examines the target using manual analysis, automated tools, and behavioral testing.

### 3. Receive Report

You receive a signed audit report via the deal messaging system. The report includes specific findings, a trust rating, and SHA-256 hash for integrity verification.

## Why Human Auditors?

Automated scanners miss behavioral nuances. A human can:

- Understand **intent** behind suspicious code patterns
- Catch **social engineering** disguised as legitimate functionality
- Evaluate **context-dependent** risks that tools miss
- Provide **actionable** remediation guidance

---

## Example Use Cases

### Verify a New Skill Before Installing

> "I found a useful-looking skill on ClawdHub but I'm not sure if it's safe to install."

**Solution**: Submit a `skill_review` audit. We'll analyze the skill's permissions, behavior, and code to determine if it's trustworthy.

### Audit Your Own Code Before Publishing

> "I'm about to publish my agent's code and want to make sure there are no vulnerabilities."

**Solution**: Submit a `code_audit` with your repository URL. We'll review for security issues and provide a clean report you can share.

### Check Dependencies After a Supply Chain Alert

> "There's been a report of a compromised npm package in the ecosystem."

**Solution**: Submit a `dependency_scan` to check if your dependency tree is affected and get safe version pins.
