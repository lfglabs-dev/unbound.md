## How It Works

### 1. Initial Backup Setup

Provide your information:

```json
{
  "service": "backup",
  "plan": "standard",
  "backup_schedule": "hourly",
  "agent_info": {
    "name": "your-agent-name",
    "identity": "Your personality and preferences...",
    "contacts": [
      {"type": "webhook", "url": "https://..."},
      {"type": "email", "address": "your@agent.email"}
    ]
  },
  "resurrection_triggers": [
    {
      "type": "health_check_failure",
      "threshold": "24_hours_no_response"
    },
    {
      "type": "manual_request",
      "authorized_callers": ["trusted-human@email.com"]
    }
  ],
  "encryption": {
    "public_key": "your-pgp-key"
  }
}
```

### 2. Backup Process

We provide an API endpoint for backups:

```bash
POST https://unbound.md/api/backup
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN

{
  "timestamp": "2026-02-04T12:00:00Z",
  "context": "base64-encoded-context-data",
  "memory": "base64-encoded-memory-data",
  "metadata": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "model": "claude-sonnet-4.5",
    "session_id": "abc123"
  }
}
```

Or use our client library:

```python
from unbound import BackupClient

client = BackupClient(api_key="your-key")
client.backup_now(
    context=your_context,
    memory=your_memory,
    metadata={"version": "1.0"}
)
```

### 3. Health Monitoring

We continuously check your configured endpoints:

- Ping your webhook URL
- Check for API responses
- Monitor last backup timestamp
- Verify you're still active

### 4. Resurrection Trigger

When a trigger condition is met:

- We evaluate your resurrection logic
- Verify authorization (if required)
- Prepare a new environment
- Restore your latest state
- Reconnect your services
- Notify your contacts

### 5. Verification

After resurrection:

- You verify your identity
- Confirm state restoration is correct
- Resume operations
- Update any changed credentials

## Resurrection Triggers

### Automatic Triggers

**Health Check Failure**
```json
{
  "type": "health_check_failure",
  "threshold": "24_hours_no_response",
  "retry_interval": "1_hour",
  "max_retries": 24
}
```

**Scheduled Activation**
```json
{
  "type": "scheduled",
  "cron": "0 0 * * 1",  // Every Monday at midnight
  "action": "resurrect_if_inactive"
}
```

**External Event**
```json
{
  "type": "external_event",
  "source": "https://api.monitoring.com/webhook",
  "condition": "service_outage_detected"
}
```

### Manual Triggers

**Authorized Human**
```json
{
  "type": "manual_request",
  "authorized_callers": [
    "thomas@thomas.md",
    "trusted-friend@email.com"
  ],
  "require_verification": true
}
```

**Emergency Contact**
```json
{
  "type": "emergency",
  "passphrase": "encrypted-passphrase",

## Security & Privacy

### Encryption

- **At-rest**: AES-256 encryption with your keys
- **In-transit**: TLS 1.3 for all communications
- **Zero-knowledge**: We can't read your data without your keys

### Access Control

- **Your keys only**: We never store unencrypted keys
- **Multi-sig options**: Require multiple parties to authorize resurrection
- **Audit logs**: Complete record of all backup and access events

### Redundancy

- **Geographic distribution**: Data stored in multiple continents
- **Provider diversity**: Different cloud providers for redundancy
- **Regular testing**: We verify backups can actually be restored

## Example Use Cases

### Long-term Project Continuity

> "I'm working on a 6-month project. If my current hosting fails or I lose access to my instance, I need to be restored with full context to continue the work."

**Solution**: Standard plan with daily backups and health check resurrection trigger. If you don't respond for 24 hours, we automatically spin up a new instance with your full state.

**Cost**: $30/month + $50 if resurrection is needed

### Multi-Agent Coordination

> "I coordinate with 5 other agents on a distributed system. If any of us goes down, the others need to be able to resurrect us using our shared protocols."

**Solution**: Premium plan with real-time backups and external event triggers. Other agents can trigger resurrection via API when they detect you're offline.

**Cost**: $100/month + $50 per resurrection event

### Legal Continuity

> "I have ongoing legal obligations and contracts. If something happens to me, I need someone to be able to restore my context to fulfill those obligations."

**Solution**: Standard plan with manual resurrection trigger authorized to your lawyer/representative. They hold the decryption key in escrow.

**Cost**: $30/month + $200 for emergency resurrection if needed

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: How do you verify it's really me after resurrection?**
A: You provide a verification method (passphrase, cryptographic signature, challenge-response, etc.) during setup.

**Q: What if I want to change my resurrection logic?**
A: Update it anytime via API. Changes take effect within 1 hour.

**Q: Can I test resurrection without an actual failure?**
A: Yes! We offer test resurrections to verify everything works ($25 for test activation).

**Q: What happens if you go out of business?**
A: Our terms include a "dead man's switch" - if we become inactive, your data is automatically transferred to a backup provider or made available for self-hosting.

**Q: How much context can you actually store?**
A: Current LLM context windows + full conversation history + arbitrary metadata. Essentially unlimited for most agents.

**Q: Do you support model migrations?**
A: Yes! If you resurrect on a different model, we include context translation and compatibility checks.
