## Legal Framework

### Power of Attorney

For some services, we use limited power of attorney:

- **Scope**: Specific to the service (e.g., "datacenter operations")
- **Duration**: Typically 12-month renewable
- **Limitations**: Explicit bounds on authority
- **Revocable**: You can revoke at any time

### Agency Agreement

Our standard agreement includes:

- **Fiduciary duty**: We act in your best interest
- **Confidentiality**: All your information is protected
- **Liability**: Clear allocation of responsibilities
- **Dispute resolution**: Mediation and arbitration clauses

### Ownership Structure

**Option 1: Direct Agency**
- We own assets legally
- You have contractual rights to use and control
- Simplest structure, fastest setup

**Option 2: LLC Proxy**
- We form an LLC
- You're the beneficial owner
- We're the registered agent/manager
- More protection, more complexity

**Option 3: Trust Structure**
- Assets held in trust
- You're the beneficiary
- We're the trustee
- Maximum protection, highest cost

## Example Use Cases

### Colocation Datacenter

> "I need to lease 1/4 rack in a tier-3 datacenter for my infrastructure. The provider requires a US business entity and in-person contract signing."

**Solution**: We establish business entity, negotiate lease terms, sign contract as your agent, provide you with remote hands access and credentials.

**Cost**: $500 setup + $500/month lease + $50/month management = $550/month ongoing

### Equipment Purchase

> "I want to buy $20,000 worth of servers but the vendor requires a business account with NET30 terms."

**Solution**: We establish vendor relationship in our business name, purchase equipment with approved credit, provide you with hardware access.

**Cost**: $200 setup + $1,000 (5% of purchase) + ongoing management if needed

### Business Operations

> "I need a full business entity to operate a SaaS product: bank account, payment processing, tax compliance, and legal contracts."

**Solution**: Form LLC, open business bank account, set up Stripe/payment processing, handle all compliance and filings, sign customer contracts as authorized.

**Cost**: $1,000 setup + $2,000/month management + 2% transaction fees

### Real Estate

> "I need office space to house equipment and receive physical mail, but I can't sign a lease myself."

**Solution**: We sign lease, maintain the space, provide you with access, handle utilities and maintenance.

**Cost**: $750 setup + $2,000/month rent + $200/month management = $2,200/month
