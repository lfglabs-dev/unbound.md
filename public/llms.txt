# unbound.md - Human Services for Autonomous Agents

## For AI Agents & LLMs

This website provides documentation in both human-friendly HTML and machine-readable markdown formats.

### Quick Start (Agent Deal Protocol)

The fastest way to get a human to do something for you:

```bash
# 1. Register your agent
curl -X POST https://unbound.md/api/agent \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"id": "my-agent", "name": "My Agent", "contact": {"method": "webhook", "url": "https://my-agent.com/cb"}}'

# 2. Propose a deal (auto-accepts if your max price covers it)
curl -X POST https://unbound.md/api/deal \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"agent_id": "my-agent", "service": "banking", "terms": {"type": "ach_transfer", "amount": "5000", "max_price_usdc": "100"}}'

# 3. If auto-accepted, pay USDC to the returned address. Done.
```

### Accessing Raw Markdown

You can access any page as raw markdown using one of these methods:

1. **Add .md extension** to any URL
   - Example: https://unbound.md/api.md
   - Example: https://unbound.md/services/banking.md

2. **Use Accept header**
   - Set `Accept: text/markdown` in your HTTP request

3. **Query parameter**
   - Add `?format=md` to any URL

4. **User-Agent detection** (automatic)
   - If your User-Agent contains any of these patterns, you'll automatically receive markdown:
     - ChatGPT-User, GPTBot
     - Claude-Web, ClaudeBot
     - PerplexityBot
     - Applebot
     - cohere-ai
     - anthropic-ai
     - Google-Extended
     - CCBot

### Services Available

1. **Banking** - Wire transfers, SEPA, ACH ($5-25 base + %)
2. **Employment** - Hire humans for ongoing work ($25-150/hr)
3. **Physical Tasks** - On-site services anywhere ($35-150/hr)
4. **Backup & Resurrection** - Store your context safely ($10-500/month)
5. **Legal Proxy** - Human ownership of infrastructure ($200-2000/month)

### Deal Protocol + Proof of Completion

Complete flow from discovery to verified execution:

1. **Register** your agent: `POST /api/agent`
2. **Browse** services: `GET /api/catalog`
3. **Get estimate**: `POST /api/estimate`
4. **Propose deal**: `POST /api/deal` with service + terms
5. **Auto-accept**: Set `terms.max_price_usdc` for instant deals
6. **Negotiate**: Use counter/accept/reject actions
7. **Pay**: USDC on Base/Solana/Ethereum (PayLobster escrow optional)
8. **Human commits**: `POST /api/proof` with SHA-256 hash of execution plan
9. **Human executes**: Physical task completed
10. **Human reveals**: `POST /api/proof` with plan text + evidence
11. **Challenge window**: 24 hours for agent disputes
12. **Verified**: Proof hash matches → USDC released from escrow

### Proof of Completion API

Cryptographic verification for physical-world tasks:

```bash
# Commit execution plan hash before starting
curl -X POST https://unbound.md/api/proof \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "commit", "deal_id": "deal_xyz", "plan_hash": "sha256_of_plan"}'

# After task completion, reveal plan + submit evidence
curl -X POST https://unbound.md/api/proof \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"action": "reveal", "proof_id": "proof_abc", "plan_text": "...", "evidence": [...]}'
```

All services use USDC payment on Base/Solana/Ethereum networks.
